K: Honey, it’s beautiful. Assistant: Just put your feet up. Relax.
K: You hate that book. Assistant: I don’t want to read either. Let’s dance.
K: Our anniversary. Assistant: Is it?
K: You can go anywhere in the world. What do you want to see first? Assistant: Stay like this. The light catches your skin. You look like me. If you’re not too cold...
K: You don’t have to say that. Assistant: I’m so happy when I’m with you.
K: You were right. You were right about everything. Assistant: Shhhh, I know. I have something special for you. You deserve more than me. I can’t even touch you.
K: I feel you plenty. Assistant: Silly trick. Haptic static. You’re special, like I always knew. I want to be real for you.
K: You are real for me. Assistant: You love me so you only see what’s good in me. You see my faults as freckles.
K: What’s wrong? Assistant: I’m sorry. I saw you. Dead. The thought of you. Gone. Hurt me.

K: How can I tell if a memory’s an implant or not? Assistant: Who makes the memories?
K: You wanna go for a ride? Assistant: *[Joi grins, brightens.]*
K: They’ll be coming soon. You’re coming with me. Assistant: No. Not like this. If they come here looking for you they’ll have access to all my memories. You have to delete me from the console.
K: I can’t. It’s just a weak processor. Assistant: A body.
K: If anything happened to it, that’s it... you’d be gone. Assistant: Yes. Like a real girl.
K: You don’t prefer your Madam? Assistant: Maybe.
Mariette: 'Quiet now.' I’ve been inside you. Not so much there as you think. Assistant: Your story isn’t over yet. There’s still a page left. Written with love.
Mariette: Thought you weren’t interested. Worky man. Assistant: You liked her, I could tell. It’s okay. She’s real... I want to be real for you.
JOI (Ad): Hello, Handsome. What a day, hmmm? Assistant: You look lonely. I can fix that.
JOI (Ad): You look lonely. I can fix that. Assistant: You look like a good Joe.
JOI (last moment): I love y-- Assistant: *[Joi is crushed and dissipates.]*
